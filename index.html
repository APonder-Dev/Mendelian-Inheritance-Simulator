            <h2>What is Mendelian Genetics?</h2>
            <p>Mendelian genetics is the study of how traits are inherited from one generation to the next, based on the work of Gregor Mendel. Mendel discovered that traits are passed on through discrete units called alleles, which can be dominant or recessive.</p>
            <p>In this simulator, you can explore how different traits are inherited based on the combinations of alleles from the parents.</p>

          <h2>Common Traits Explored</h2>
          
          <h3>Eye Color</h3>
          <p>Eye color is determined by multiple genes, with brown being the dominant trait over blue and green.</p>
          
          <h3>Skin Color</h3>
          <p>Skin color is a polygenic trait influenced by several genes that produce a wide range of shades.</p>
          
          <h3>Height</h3>
          <p>Height is also influenced by many genes and can be affected by environmental factors.</p>
          
          <h3>Blood Type</h3>
          <p>
              Blood type is determined by the presence of specific antigens on the surface of red blood cells. 
              The ABO blood group system includes types A, B, AB, and O, with O being the most common. 
              Additionally, the Rh factor can be either positive or negative, providing further classification of blood types.
