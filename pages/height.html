                <h2>Understanding Height Inheritance</h2>
                <p>Height is influenced by a combination of genetic and environmental factors. While genetics play a significant role, other factors like nutrition and health during childhood can also affect a person's final height.</p>
                <p>Typically, children inherit height traits from their parents. Studies show that the height of a child can generally fall within a range determined by their parents' heights.</p>

                <h2>Height Inheritance Patterns</h2>
                <p>While each child is unique, it is common for their heights to be somewhat between the heights of their parents. Various studies suggest that children can be, on average, within 4 inches (10 cm) of the average of their parents' heights.</p>
